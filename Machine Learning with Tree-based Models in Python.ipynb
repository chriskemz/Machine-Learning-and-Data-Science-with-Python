    "## Decision tree for classification\n",
    "\n",
    "__Classification Tree__ \\\n",
    "A Classification Tree is a supervised learning model that predicts a categorical label (like 'Yes'/'No' or 'Spam'/'Not Spam') by learning a series of simple if/else decision rules from the data. The best way to think about it is as an automated flowchart. The model asks a sequence of questions to the data, and each answer leads it down a different path until it reaches a final decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you're playing a game where your friend is thinking of an animal.\n",
    "\n",
    "* You ask: \"Does it live in water?\" (This is your first split)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Answer: Yes. -> You then ask: \"Does it have fins?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "* Answer: No. -> You then ask: \"Is it a mammal?\" \\\n",
    "You continue asking these simple questions to narrow down the possibilities until you can make a final guess. A classification tree learns the most efficient sequence of questions to ask to classify your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast to linear models, trees are able to capture non-linear relationships between features and labels. In addition, trees do not require the features to be on the same scale, for example through standardization.\n",
    "\n",
    "__How Does a Classification Tree Work?__ \\\n",
    "The \"magic\" of a decision tree is how it learns which questions to ask and in what order. It does this by finding the splits that create the \"purest\" possible subgroups.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. __Start with all data__: The tree starts with all your data in one group at the top (the root node).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. __Find the Best Split__: The algorithm looks at every single feature and finds the one question (the best split) that does the best job of separating the data into distinct classes. For example, it might find that asking \"Is the weather outlook sunny?\" is the best first question because it perfectly separates many of the \"Go to Beach\" vs. \"Stay Home\" outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. __Measure \"Purity\"__: It determines the \"best\" split using a metric like Gini Impurity. Gini impurity is a measure of how mixed up the classes are in a group. A Gini of 0 means a group is perfectly pure (all one class). The algorithm chooses the split that leads to the biggest decrease in impurity.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. __Repeat__: The process is repeated for each new subgroup. The tree continues to split the data into smaller and smaller, purer and purer groups until it reaches a stopping point (e.g., a group is perfectly pure, or the tree reaches a pre-defined maximum depth).\n",
    "\n",
    "The maximum number of branches separating the top from an exreme end is known as the __maximum depth__. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Decision region__ \\\n",
    "A decision region is a region in the feature space where all instances in one region are assigned only to one class label. These regions are separated by surfaces called __Decision boundaries__. The decision boundary produced by logistic regression is linear while the boundaries produced by the classification tree divide the feature space into rectangular regions."

In classification tree, the goal is to create subgroups that are as \"pure\" as possible (containing mostly one class), in which case the prediction will be the majority in a leaf node. However, in regression tree, the goal is to create subgroups where the target values are as similar as possible to each other. The prediction is the average of the target values in a leaf node.\n",

In reality, data generalization is always accompanied with randomness or noise. Your goal is to find a model, $\\hat{f}$ that best approximates $f$. $\\hat{f}$ can be Logistic regression, Decision Tree, Neural Network, etc. When training  $\\hat{f}$, you want to make sure that noise is discarded as much as possible. At the end,  $\\hat{f}$ should achieve a low predictive error on unseen datasets.\n",

    "When a model overfits the training the set, its predictive power on unseen datasets is pretty low. The model will memorize the noise present in the training set. Such model achieves a low training set error and a high test set error. When a model underfits the data, the training set error is roughly equal to the test set error. However, both errors are relatively high. As a result, the trained model is not flexible enough to capture the complex dependency between features and labels.\n",

    "2. __Variance error__: This tells you how much $\\hat{f}$ is inconsistent over different training sets. A high-variance model learns the \"noise\" in the training data, not just the signal. A high variance model leads to overfitting\n",

To obtain a reliable estimate of $\\hat{f}$'s performance, use a technique called __cross-validation__ (CV). CV can be performed using K-Fold CV or Hold-Out CV. Let's focus on K-Fold. Here, the training set is split randomly into a number of folds, say 10. The error of $\\hat{f}$ is evaluated ten times on the 10 folds. Each time, one fold is picked for evaluation after training $\\hat{f}$ on the other 9 folds. At the end, you will obtain a list of 10 errors.

In addition, you may also gather more data to train $\\hat{f}$.\n",

    "Previously, we saw that Voting Classifier is an ensemble of models that are fit to the same training set using different algorithms. We also saw that the final predictions were obtained by majority voting. In Bagging, the ensemble is formed by models that use the same training algorithm. However, these models are not trained on the entire training set. Instead, each model is trained on a different subset of the data. This aims to improve the stability and accuracy of a machine learning model by reducing variance and preventing overfitting.\n",

    "Bagging stands for Boostrap Aggregation. Its name refers to the fact that it uses a technique known as __bootstrap__. Consider the case where you have 3 balls labeled A, B, and C. A bootstrap sample is a sample drawn with replacement. In the training phase, bagging consists of N different boostrap samples from the training set. Each of these bootstrap samples are then used to train N models that use the same algorithm. When a new instance is fed to the different models forming the bagging ensemble, each model output its prediction. The meta-model collects these predictions and outputs a final prediction depending on the nature of the problem. In classification, the final prediction is obtained by majority voting. The corresponding classifier in scikit-learn is _BaggingClassifier_. In regression, the final prediction is the average of the predictions made by the individual models forming the ensemble.

    "In bagging, the base estimator could be any model including the decision-tree, logistic regression, neural network. Each estimator is trained on a distinct bootstrap sample drawn from the training set, using all available features. Random forest is an ensemble method that uses a desicion tree as a base estimator. In Random Forests, each estimator is trained on a different bootstrap sample having the same size as the training set. Random forests introduces further randomization than bagging when training each of the base estimators. When each tree is trained, only d features can be sampled at each node without replacement, where d is a number smaller than the total number of features. The node is then split using the sampled feature that maximizes information gain. In scikit-learn, d defaults to the square root of the number of features. For example, if there are 100 features, only 10 features are sampled at each node. Once trained, predictons can be made on new instances. When a new instance is fed to the different base estimators, each of them outputs a prediction. The predictions are then collected by the random forests meta-model and a final prediction is made depending on the nature of the problem. For classification, the final prediction is made by majority voting. The corresponding scikit-learn class is _RandomForestClassifier_. For regression, the final prediction is the average of all the labels predicted by the base estimators. The corresponding scikit-learn class is _RandomForestRegressor_. In general, random forests achieve a lower variance than individual trees.\n",

    "## Boosting\n",
    "\n",
    "Boosting refers to an ensemble in which many predictors (models) are trained, and each predictor learns from the errors of its predecessor. In boosting, several weak learners are combined to form a strong learner. A weak learner is a model doing slightly better than random guessing. For example, a decision tree with a maximum-depth of one, known as a __decision stump__, is a weak learner. In boosting, an ensemble of predictors are trained sequentially, and each predictor tries to correct the errors made by its predecessors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two most popular boosting methods are:\n",
    "1. Adaboost\n",
    "2. Gradient boosting\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Adaboost\n",
    "\n",
    "Adaboost stands for __Adaptive Boosting__. In Adaboost, each predictor pays attention to the instances wrongly predicted by its predecessor by constantly changing the weights of the training instances. Furthermore, each predictor is assigned a coefficient , $\\alpha$, that weighs its contribution in the ensemble's final prediction. $\\alpha$ depends on the predictor's training error. Lets asssume there are N predictors in total. First, predictor1 is trained on the initial dataset (X,y), and the training error for predictor1 is determined. This error can then be used to determine $\\alpha_1$ which is predictor1's coefficient. $\\alpha_1$ is then used to determine the weights W(2) of the training instances for predictor2. As a result, the incorrectly predicted instances acquire higher weights. When the weighted instances are used to train predictor2, this predictor is forced to pay more attention to the incorrectly predicted instances. This process is repeated sequentially, until the N predictors forming the ensemble are trained.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Learning rate__ \\\n",
    "An important parameter used in training is the learning rate, $\\eta$. $\\eta$ is a number between 0 and 1; it is used to shrink the coefficient alpha of a trained predictor. It's important to note that there's a trade-off between eta and the number of estimators. A smaller value of $\\eta$ should be compensated by a greater number of estimators.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Prediction__ \\\n",
    "Once all the predictors in the ensemble are trained, the label of a new instance can be predicted depending on the nature of the problem. For classification, each predictor predicts the label of the new instance and the ensemble's prediction is obtained by weighted majority voting. The corresponding class in scikit-learn is _AdaBoostClassifier_. For regression, the same procedure is applied and the ensemble's prediction is obtained by performing a weighted average. The corresponding class in scikit-learn is _AdaBoostRegressor_. It's important to note that individual predictors need not to be CARTs. However CARTs are used most of the time in boosting because of their high variance."

    "In gradient boosting, each predictor in the ensemble corrects its predecessor's error. In contrast to Adaboost, the weights of the training instances are not tweaked. Instead, each predictor is trained using the residual errors of its predecessor as labels. Let's further explain gradient boosting with the analogy below: \n",
    "* The Goal: To create a perfectly accurate portrait of a person.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Artist 1 (The First Weak Learner): Makes a very simple, rough initial sketch of the person's face. It's a bad prediction. The \"error\" (the residual) is the difference between this rough sketch and the actual person's face.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The \"Boost\": The team leader doesn't show the original photo to the second artist. Instead, they show them a picture of the error—a ghostly image highlighting where the first sketch was wrong (e.g., \"the nose is too short,\" \"the chin is too wide\").\n",
    "\n",
    "* Artist 2: This artist's only job is to create a drawing of just those corrections.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The Final Portrait: The final, accurate portrait is created by taking the first rough sketch, then adding the corrections from Artist 2, then adding the corrections from Artist 3, and so on. Each artist makes a small, incremental improvement, gradually turning the rough sketch into a masterpiece.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now lets asssume there are N trees in an ensemble. Tree1 is trained using the features matrix X and the dataset labels y. The predictions labeled $\\hat{y_1}$ are used to determine the training set residual errors r1. Tree2 is then trained using the features matrix X and the residual errors r1 of Tree1 as labels. The predicted residuals $\\hat{r_1}$  are then used to determine the residuals of residuals which are labeled r2. This process is repeated until all of the N trees forming the ensemble are trained.\n",

In this context, shrinkage refers to the fact that the prediction of each tree in the ensemble is shrinked after it is multiplied by a learning rate $\\eta$ which is a number between 0 and 1. Similarly to AdaBoost, there's a trade-off between $\\eta$  and the number of estimators. Decreasing the learning rate needs to be compensated by increasing the number of estimators in order for the ensemble to reach a certain performance.\n",

    "## Stochastic Gradient Boosting\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient boosting involves an exhaustive search procedure. Each tree in the ensemble is trained to find the best split-points and the best features. This procedure may lead to CARTs that use the same split-points and possibly the same features. To mitigate these effects, you can use an algorithm known as __stochastic gradient boosting__. Stochastic Gradient Boosting (SGB) is a modification of the Gradient Boosting method that incorporates randomness to improve its performance and reduce overfitting. The \"stochastic\" part simply means random. It combines the error-correcting, sequential nature of Gradient Boosting with the random sampling idea from Bagging. In stochastic gradient boosting, each CART is trained on a random subset of the training data. This subset is sampled without replacement. Furthermore, at the level of each node, features are sampled without replacement when choosing the best split-points. As a result, this creates further diversity in the ensemble and the net effect is adding more variance to the ensemble of trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets describe the training procedure of Stochastic Gradient Boosting. First, instead of providing all the training instances to a tree, only a fraction of these instances are provided through sampling without replacement. The sampled data is then used for training a tree. However, not all features are considered when a split is made. Instead, only a certain randomly sampled fraction of these features are used for this purpose. Once a tree is trained, predictions are made and the residual errors can be computed. These residual errors are multiplied by the learning rate $\\eta$ and are fed to the next tree in the ensemble. This procedure is repeated sequentially until all the trees in the ensemble are trained. The prediction procedure for a new instance in stochastic gradient boosting is similar to that of gradient boosting.\n",
    "\n",
    "In scikit-learn, Stochastic Gradient Boosting isn't a separate model. It's implemented directly within GradientBoostingRegressor and GradientBoostingClassifier using the _subsample_ hyperparameter. The subsample is set so each tree samples a particular percentage of the data. The parameter _max_features_ can also be set so that each tree uses a particular percentage of available features to perform the best-split."

    "## Tuning a CART's Hyperparameters\n",
    "\n",
    "To obtain a better performance, the hyperparameters of a machine learning mpdel should be tuned. Machine learning models are characterized by parameters and hyperparameters. Parameters are learned from data through training; examples of parameters include the split-feature and the split-point of a node in a CART. Hyperparameters are not learned from data; they should be set prior to training. Examples of hyperparameters include the maximum-depth, min_samples_leaf, and the splitting-criterion of a CART.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Hyperparameter tuning__ \\\n",
    "Hyperparameter tuning consists of searching for the set of optimal hyperparameters for the learning algorithm. The solution involves finding the set of optimal hyperparameters that yields an optimal model. The optimal model yields an optimal score. The score function measures the agreement between true labels and a model's predictions. In sklearn, it defaults to accuracy for classifiers and r-squared for regressors. A model's generalization performance is evaluated using __cross-validation__.\n",
    "\n",
    "A legitimate question that you may ask is: why bother tuning hyperparameters? Well, in scikit-learn, a model's default hyperparameters are not optimal for all problems. Hyperparameters should be tuned to obtain the best model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many approaches for hyperparameter tuning including: grid-search, random-search, bayeisian optimization, genetic algorithms, and so on. Here, we'll only be exploring the method of grid-search.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Grid-search Cross Validation__ \\\n",
    "In grid-search cross-validation, first you manually set a grid of discrete hyperparameter values. Then, you pick a metric for scoring model performance and you search exhaustively through the grid. For each set of hyperparameters, you evaluate each model's score. The optimal hyperparameters are those for which the model achieves the best cross-validation score. Note that grid-search suffers from the curse of dimensionality, i.e., the bigger the grid, the longer it takes to find the solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's walk through a concrete example to understand this procedure. Consider the case of a CART where you search through the two-dimensional hyperparameter grid shown here: \\\n",
    "max__depth = {2,3,4} \\\n",
    "min_samples_leaf = {0.05, 0.1} \\\n",
    "The dimensions correspond to the CART's maximum-depth and the minimum-percentage of samples per leaf. For each combination of hyperparameters, the cross-validation score is evaluated using k-fold CV for example. Finally, the optimal hyperparameters correspond to the model achieving the best cross-validation score.\n",
    "\n",
    "To inspect hyperparameters in scikit-learn, first instantiate a DecisionTreeClassifier. call ._get_params()_  method to print out a dictionary where the keys are the hyperparameter names like max_depth, max_features and min_samples_leaf. Note that max_features is the number of features to consider when looking for the best split. When it's a float, it is interpreted as a percentage. You can learn more about these hyperparameters by consulting scikit-learn's documentation."
